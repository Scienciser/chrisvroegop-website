This is my personal website, accessible [here](https://chrisvroegop.com). It is an SPA written in React.

## Local development

```
npm install
npm run serve
```
This runs the app at `localhost:8080` using `webpack-dev-server`.

## Production build
```
npm run prod:bundler
```
Files are output to the `dist/` directory.
